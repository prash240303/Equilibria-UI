## Problem 

Many people, particularly students, rely on task management software to manage their daily duties or schedules. We use multiple platforms for our academic and non-academic lives, and a lot of tasks and data are incoming to them. Managing all the work on time and avoiding distractions in a setting where we have to work with our devices for hours is difficult. This is according to a number of my friends, batchmates, and myself.
so as to urge them to try out new activities and hobbies in groups and to encourage them to manage their daily schedule.

The crux is the matter that we find difficult to maintain an “Equilibrium” in our life.  

## problems faced by the users 
Following major problems are faced by students : 

1. unable to remember the task they need to do and end up doing things on deadline and even miss out on things and cause chaos. 
  
  ex: Many students have trouble recalling the activities, gatherings, or any form of a seminar.
handling various college information and homework on WhatsApp and in the classroom proved challenging.

2. find difficulty in focusing on our assigned task or study due to distractions of social media apps or games etc.
      ex: A lot of students waste a lot of time scrolling Instagram or any other social media app or game and in the end regret wasting time which they were supposed to study. 
 
3. Difficulty in finding peers with similar interests or hobbies.
     ex:  I myself hard to find people who do art. I really like to talk to people who do art but find it difficult to find one in my own environment.

4. Not able to find the motivation to start something new alone. 
     ex:  I personally want to start animation but don't have enough courage to start it alone, but if I find a whole community that can uplift my desire to try out animation.
     
     
## User needs
- As a user I want: a checklist where I can manage the daily tasks I need to do in the day and the app need to remind me at a particular set time with a notification. 
- As a user: I want a focused interface where I can do the Pomorodo method of study or any work. 
- As a user: I want a place where I can find peers with the same hobbies
- As a user:  I want my class assignments, meets, and any other information conveyed by the professors or officials on one platform. 


## solution 
so I came up with the idea of the "EQUILIBRIA" app platform, a multifunctional interaction for students which helps them maintain a good daily schedule and work/study flow. this app integrates the features provided by different other apps but free of cost and with a better experience.




FEATURES
- Time management can best be accomplished by creating a schedule that can be updated according to the tasks at hand.
 
- Reminders feature helps the user to organize his/her schedule.

- The Pomodoro feature provides stress-free study time slots where you can set timers and block out other distracting apps for focusing and take breaks at equal intervals of time.


- communities feature functions two tasks : 
1) It serves as a platform for broadcasting helpful information, assignments, meetings, or any other kind of information that the admin want to disseminate in their particular community. 
ex: I may look in the CSE community to find out information on the assignments, tests, and other things.

2)  It can act as a platform where I can interact with people of my interests and domain. 
ex: I can look into the online art community where people discuss art and can learn about any forthcoming competitions or other relevant information.
